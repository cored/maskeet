h1. Maskeet 

I began with this documentaion effort because i did not find any good step by step tutorial to learn Merb.  
The entire tutorial will be in the wiki page for this repository. 

This tutorial is a port of the Askeet tutorial for the Symfony web framework (http://www.symfony-project.org/askeet/1_0/en).

h1. Contribuiting

You know the basics of contribuiting in Github just fork the project and begin throwing docs or code.

Thanks
